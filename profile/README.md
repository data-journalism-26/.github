### Course contents

In a world where data shapes public discourse and policymaking, communicating evidence clearly and credibly is essential. In this elective, you learn how data journalism can translate complex information into accessible narratives that inform, persuade, and hold power to account.

The first part of the course examines what research reveals about how people consume numerical and visual information — including what works in communicating data, polls, and uncertainty. It also considers the role of data journalism in comparative perspective, exploring its potential and limitations in both democratic and authoritarian contexts.

The second part focuses on practical skills: identifying and evaluating data sources, collecting web data, conducting data-driven investigations with geographical data, creating effective visualizations, and writing for clarity and impact.

In the third part, you apply these skills by developing your own data journalism project from conception to near-publication. With feedback from guest experts, you work toward producing a professional-quality story that combines analytical rigor with journalistic storytelling. This part is planned to feature a field trip to visit data journalists in a newsroom.
